# rest-fuzzer

This repo contains the source code for a prototype named rest-fuzzer. This prototype has been used to perform experiments during my thesis process. 

This prototype is an extended version from the rest-fuzzer project initially created by Arjan Gerritsen. The prototype is able to perform various types of fuzzing on REST web services. This varies from basic-fuzzing to model-based blackbox fuzzing.
