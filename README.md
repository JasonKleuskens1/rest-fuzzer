# rest-fuzzer

This repo contains the source code for rest-fuzzer. This prototype has been used to perform experiments during my thesis process. 

This prototype is an extended version from the rest-fuzzer project initially created by Arjan Gerritsen. The prototype can perform various types of fuzzing on REST web services. This varies from basic-fuzzing (mutation-based) to model-based (generation-based) approaches.
